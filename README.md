# jsfeatNext-examples

A simple showcase for the [jsfeatNext](https://github.com/webarkit/jsfeatNext) repository. You can find here a set of examples written in the Typescript language as the original repository. Good as a starting point to develop applications with this library. We used webpack to bundle the code but you an use your preferred bundler as well.
